A generative music patch which represents the history of the Earth and humanity. 

The aim is to design a generative system which represents the history of the Earth and humanity beginning from the Big Bang and ending at the present. I used a logarithmic timeline to specify eco-spherical and anthropological events. So it encapsulates almost 14 billion years.

This is a stochastic system that submits observed or learned information of generation, evolution, developments and modifications through the history. Scaled logarithmic timeline is projected to real time, I integrated those information as transitions or themes. This is not a deterministic attempt. Efficacy of every implementation inside the system is important. Feedbacks will have affects for self-regulation and self-evolution of this cybernetic environment. Every time it is started, audiences will observe another possibility of interactions of known events as a sonic representation.

To design a self-creative model of a self-creative system I am going to benefit from some principles:

-Second law of thermodynamics points the probability of events by ensuring the information of that; entropy never decreases in isolated systems. Disorder of the system tends to get higher to close thermodynamic equilibrium. To stay in order, everything needs to dissipate energy to the environment. By interacting of organisms, system evolves and life maintains life.
-According to second order cybernetics, observing a system changes both the observer and the system itself. Thus I am planning to take an input (possibly sound recording) from environment which interacts with the system. Also this will have effects on reproduction of overall output.

I am seeing this approach as an experiment that may provide an output which could trigger new ideas and perspectives about how I comprehend the Earth and everything related to it.
